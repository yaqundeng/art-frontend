# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# frontend-artportfolio

Our team name is Hala Madrid, and the team members are Wen Huang, Yaqun Deng, and Yichen Han.

Wen posted the Iteration 0.1, and Yichen drew wireframe and posted the iteration 0.2 on Piazza, and the whole team discussed the ideas and functionality of the team project. In the iteration 1, Yaqun developed frame the front end of the project, and Wen designed the back end of the project and create ed the team GitHub repository. Yichen updated the GitHub readme file and posted everything required. Also, Yichen connected the Altas with local Mongodb, and deployed the whole app on Heroku.

In the next week, Wen and Yichen will work on the backend together. Wen will focus on the database side and Yichen will be responsible to add the AWS to the backend. Also, Yaqun will develop the front end and work on a React library and apply it on the project.

Our team communicates with each other frequently, and the process is going smoothly.

This is the backend: https://artportfolio-backend.herokuapp.com/
