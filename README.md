Our team name is Hala Madrid, and the team members are Wen Huang, Yaqun Deng, and Yichen Han.

Wen posted the Iteration 0.1, and Yichen drew wireframe and posted the iteration 0.2 on Piazza, and the whole team discussed the ideas and functionality of the team project. In the iteration 1, Yaqun developed frame the front end of the project, and Wen designed the back end of the project and create ed the team GitHub repository. Yichen updated the GitHub readme file and posted everything required. Also, Yichen connected the Altas with local Mongodb, and deployed the whole app on Heroku.

In the next week, Wen and Yichen will work on the backend together. Wen will focus on the database side and Yichen will be responsible to add the AWS to the backend. Also, Yaqun will develop the front end and work on a React library and apply it on the project.

Our team communicates with each other frequently, and the process is going smoothly.
